\chapter{Introduction}\label{C:us}

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the feasibility of a tool that gathers and provides snapshot reputation data from social media sites, using web-scraping as the data gathering method. In this chapter I identify the general problem that the project has been undertaken to help solve. In addition I describe the proposed solutions and core contributions of the project.

\section{The Problem}
In the digital age many social and business transactions are moving online. The size of Facebook and other Social Networking Sites (SNS) has grown exponentially with 1.05 billion monthly users on Facebook in December 2012 \cite{fb_users}. As such, defining who we should and should not trust becomes increasingly important, yet hard to resolve. Although SNS to some extent have inbuilt concepts of trust, using contact networks (Facebook, LinkedIn) and circles (Google+) for example, the concept of trustworthiness is more blurred. Tools to provide a snapshot, or hint of an individual's reputation and trustworthiness could be useful. Reputation is the global trust mechanism, whereas trust is one nodes impression of another in the network.

Reputation systems on trading websites have been extremely successful, despite the potential for fraudulent activity \cite{}. While we might expect a self-aware adult to fairly easily spot equivalent 'fraudulent' activity or deceptive behaviour on social media, many examples have shown this to be untrue. Social crowd sourcing gone wrong has also been a high-profile issue, with incidents such as the Boston Bombings \cite{}.

Various strategies have been used to infer the personality or active traits of individuals online; these have been shown to be highly accurate. Applications on SNS have been used to give people an idea of their own personality. The results can then be compared against elements of the person's use of social media. This requires the express permission of the individual concerned to gain any meaningful data, when collecting information through a site's API. Which privacy concerns must be taken into account, publicly available information on an individual or company's social media account can be considered fair game. This information could be useful when judging trustworthiness. A new approach, that does not need permission to access information which is publicly-available, is needed. 

\section{Key Issues}

To summarise, the project aims to address the following two issues:

\begin{description}
	\item [I1.] Reputation on Social Media is largely undefined.
	\item [I2.] Current tools to identify reputation on Social Media are limited by Application Program Interface specifications.
	\item [I3.] Current tools to identify reputation require express permissions by the user for whom we are interested in.
\end{description}

\section{Proposed Solution}
A solution to the above issues is to use web-scraping strategies to anonymously retrieve reputation data. A more traditional approach would be to retrieve information directly through an API, but few social networks provide sufficient APIs - and they all require express user permission to work. This system could be used to give a general snapshot about an individual, by using these non-traditional data sources. There are many potential applications and users for this sort of application. Parents might wish to get a glimpse at their child's online friends, or a company might wish to automatically get some information about a potential employee for example.

\section{Contributions}
The primary contributions of this project are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item A web-scraper for Twitter as part of a wider scraping framework
	\item A web-scraping framework that is suitable for extension onto more social networking sites
	\item A set of reputation-inferring policies for use on Twitter 
	\item A dataset of 1.7 million tweets, and associated tweet meta-data.
\end{enumerate}

%The major contribution of the project is to deliver a prototype that gathers online reputation data using web-scraping techniques.The prototype will be integrated with the GRAft reputation system \cite{graft_paper}, in order to link with a person's OpenID\cite{open_id}. Users would be able to generate a reputation value for themselves, or for others they know.
