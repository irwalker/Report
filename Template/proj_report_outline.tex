\begin{abstract}

Online reputation has become increasingly important as more social and business interactions move online. This project is concerned with investigating how we can infer basic reputation metrics from non-traditional sources such as social media sites, including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and Slashdot. The method of gathering has been through web-scraping, since most social media sites do not (understandably) have an API to retrieve this information without logging in to the system. The project has looked at developing web-scrapers to retrieve publicly-available information on social media sites, and investigating how this can be used to infer basic reputation metrics.
