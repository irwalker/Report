\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to firstly thank my supervisor Dr. Kris Bubendorfer who was endlessly free with his experience and advice. Thanks also to Ferry Hendrikx for his feedback and technical advice over the course of the project, and to my family for their support during this extremely busy year.
