\chapter{Policy Design and Implementation}\label{C:us}

This section outlines the design of the system, highlighting important decisions made during the course of the project, as well as the steps taken to implement the system based on the initial design. I break this section into two logical components; web-scraping implementation and policy implementation.

\section{Product Implementation}

%State why I chose this architecture, and how I built the application.

%Discuss some of the difficulties I faced, Infinite Scroll, Quantifying Reputation Data, Sites Requiring Authentication.

%Sites with large amounts of interactive and dynamic content are significantly more difficult to scrape data from.

\subsection{Twitter Scraper}

%How I went about implementing the Twitter scraper

\subsection{LinkedIn Scraper}

\subsection{Facebook Scraper}





%Define the architectures that I considered for implementing web-scraper

%Option one - stand-alone web scraping libraries

%Option two - extend existing web scraper, utilise this.

\section{Policy Construction}

\subsection{MapEquation}



Two phases to each facet of implementation; scraper, data understanding, and policy implementation and evaluation. Discuss each of these in seperate sections.

Define multiple hypotheses to add strength to the report

Brief description of LinkedIn Scraper. Ultimately decided that twitter had significant data interest to be the only focus of the project.

Discuss how the project was a study on what could be inferred from the data that we can access. Therefore some dead ends, etc. E.g. LinkedIn, Sentiment140 API for tweet analysis. 

Temporal analysis

Evaluation tool development

Phases of implementation for each tool. Design, implement scraper, implement data analysis components, implement evaluation components and policies.
