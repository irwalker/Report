\chapter{Requirements Analysis}\label{C:us}

To satisfy the goals of the project, the following issues need to be addressed. The requirements may be logically split into two divisions; web-scraping requirements and access policy requirements.

\begin{enumerate}
 \item Policy Generation to Approximate Reputation Values
 \item A reliability metric based on amount of data gathered
 \item Maintainability and Resistance to User-Interface Changes
 \item Scraper Performance
 \item Ability to Resist Blocking Detection and Recover from Failure
\end{enumerate}

\section{Policy Construction}

The first and most significant requirement is to generate a set of policies to assist with generating a snapshot of the reputation information of an individual. 

\section{A reliability Metric Based on the Amount of Data Considered}








%\subsection{Policy Requirements}

%\begin{number}
%\item Develop a set of Policies that can be used to ...
%\item Develop a metric of reliability of information gathered, based on privacy settings.
%\item Potential to Develop an Interface with Filip Dimitrievski's project. Re-using my web-scraping libraries could be useful for his project. (Probably not going to happen)
%\item Aggregate data for storage into GRAft
%\end{number}

%\subsection{Web Scraping Requirements}

%Web-Scraping Requirements
%\begin{number}
%\item Privacy Protection
%\item Maintainability and Resistance to User-Interface Changes
%\item Performance of Scrapers
%\item Ability to Resist Blocking Detection, and Recover from Failure
%\end{number}

Develop my set of policies... State why these are important.

\section{Resistance to User-Interface Changes}

\section{Accuracy of Information Gathered}

\section{Performance of Scrapers}

\section{Ability to Resist Blocking Detection}

\section{Privacy Protection}

The design of the application was driven by a prototyping and research based approach, which allowed me to develop a set of requirements for the project.
